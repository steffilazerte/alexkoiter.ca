## Current Projects

My work, broadly speaking, focuses on the interaction between watershed management and geomorphology and how this affects both soil erosion and downstream water quality. My principal area of research concerns sediment fingerprinting. Sediment fingerprinting is a method by which natural properties of sediment are used as tracers to track sediment back to its sources. My work has focused on soil and sediment geochemical, radionuclide and colour tracers.

My primary research project involves collaborations between Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, University of Northern BC and the University of Manitoba. In this project I use sediment fingerprinting to assess the sources of sediment within watersheds from both management and geomorphic perspectives. The two watersheds that I am currently focusing on are the South Tobacco Creek watershed in south-central Manitoba and the Black Brook watershed in north-western New Brunswick. In this project I both assess sources of sediment and refine the sediment fingerprinting approach. In particular I am evaluating different types of tracers, refining sampling and modelling techniques, and assessing the benefit of including multiple lines of evidence. Besides these research-based items, I am also developing a methodological framework to move sediment fingerprinting from a research tool to a management tool for use by environmental consultants, watershed managers and community groups.
